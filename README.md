# eDaybook
I've decided to rewrite the [Daybook](https://github.com/adelisardo/daybook) project using .NET Core 8 for the backend and Angular 18 for the frontend. The project will follow a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture to enhance maintainability and scalability.
The milestone will be released soon!
